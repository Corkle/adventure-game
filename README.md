# adventure-game
##Purpose 
This is a choose your own adventure game. The stoyline offers four options at each juncture, but some overlap.
The base code will be refactored to be arrays of objects, and then the project will be made open for public contribution. 

##Contribution
The story can use some work, and I would love to add some html canvas animations, or some sort of visual engagement. 
To contribute, fork the repo, and submit a pull request to the preview branch.
